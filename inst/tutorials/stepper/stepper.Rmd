<!-- ## Read data -->

```{python nba_setup}
import pandas as pd
nba = pd.read_csv(r.nba_data_path)
```

## nba data

```{r stepper-ex, echo=FALSE}
stepper(
  id = "stepper-ex",
  explanations = list(
    list(line = 1, text = "The first thing we want to do is groupby the CID, FE, and select the FID column."),
    list(line = 2, text = "Then we will count the numbers by the groups.")
